Stratosphere - ozone acts as a UV radiation shield by absorbing UV.123","Sulfur dioxide release is a concern for human health because even at low concentrations it
irritates the respiratory system and causes breathing difficulties. Because SO2 dissolves in water droplets, it forms acid rain that has adverse effects on the environment, for example breaking down waxy surfaces of leaves leading to deforestation."
7/17/2021 16:25:51,,Temperature in the stratosphere increases with ozone concentration.,Sulfur dioxide release is a concern for human health because even at high concentrations it irritates the respiratory system and causes breathing difficulties. SO2 reacts with hydrogen to produce acid rain that has adverse effects on the environment.
